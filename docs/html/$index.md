## Overview

Alder is a library for writing dynamic user interfaces in JavaScript. It's a
fresh reimplementation of ideas from React and Om/Reagent. Alder is much
lighter, faster, and simpler. It's about 4% the size of React, and its API
surface is much smaller.

Differences from React:
* components are pure functions
* no persistent virtual DOM
* no local component state
* no JSX; DOM is represented with plain data
* no internal event system
* lightweight change detection system (peer dependency)

Separation of concerns without separation of technologies.

<div data-unsafe></div>
<div data-safe></div>
